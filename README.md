Black Mirror (S3 E1) - NoseDive React Web App
=========
[nosedive.calebnance.com](http://nosedive.calebnance.com) built with [React](https://reactjs.org)

Welcome to the prototype app inspired by the NoseDive episode of Black Mirror Season 3 Episode 1
--------------------

This is just a fun react web app, it's not affiliated with the Netflix show at all. I loved the episode and thought it would be cool to prototype it out and see what happens.
