Black Mirror - NoseDive App
=========
nosedive.calebnance.com built with [Angular](https://angularjs.org)

Welcome to the prototype app inspired by the NoseDive episode of Black Mirror
--------------------
This is just a fun app, it's not affiliated with the Netflix show at all. I loved the episode and thought it would be cool to prototype it out and see what happens.
